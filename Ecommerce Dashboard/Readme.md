## Business Problem

The e-commerce company aims to enhance profitability and sales performance by addressing key challenges, including:

- Wants to know year on year growth profit, sales and profit margin.
- Technology, office supplies, and furniture contribute to overall sales, but the company must determine which categories are driving profits and which require improvement.
- Sales distribution across states varies significantly. Some states generate high revenue, while others underperform. The company must focus on optimizing sales strategies in low-performing regions.
- Sales by top-performing subcategories, need evaluation to improve profitability.
- The sales distribution among consumer, corporate, and home office segments should be analyzed to tailor marketing strategies effectively.<br><br>

## Findings

- While sales and order quantities are growing, the declining profit margin suggests increased costs or ineffective pricing. The company should analyze costs, discounts, and operational expenses.
- Technology products contribute the highest revenue among categories, making them a key focus for expansion and marketing.
- Some states contribute significantly to revenue, while others lag. Expanding marketing efforts in underperforming states can improve overall sales.
- Phones and chairs are the best-selling subcategories, while binders and tables need optimizationâ€”either through better promotion, bundling strategies, or discounts.
- Understanding which customer segment (Consumer, Corporate, or Home Office) drives the most revenue can help refine marketing and sales efforts.
