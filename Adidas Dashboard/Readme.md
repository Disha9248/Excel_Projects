## Findings

- Sales have shown an upward trend in 2021 compared to 2020, indicating recovery or strong demand. Adidas should analyze the reasons behind this growth and capitalize on successful strategies.
- Some regions outperform others, suggesting a need for region-specific marketing, inventory management, and logistics adjustments.
- Online sales (33%) present growth potential. Investing in digital marketing, better website experience, and exclusive online deals could boost revenue.
- While some retailers generate strong sales, others like Walmart and Amazon lag. Adidas should either improve product visibility on these platforms or focus on direct-to-consumer sales.
- Understanding which products drive the most sales can help improve inventory management, marketing focus, and product innovation.
