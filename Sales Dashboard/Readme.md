## Project Overview
This project analyzes sales data using Excel to gain insights into revenue, cost, and profitability. It includes exploratory analysis, and visualizations to track sales trends and business performance. <br><br>

## Objectives
- To analyze sales data for identifying trends and patterns.
- To visualize key sales metrics using charts and pivot tables.
- To build an interactive dashboard for dynamic data exploration.
- To derive actionable insights that can help optimize pricing and sales strategies.<br><br>


## Project Level: Beginner
This project is a beginners level project.To get me familiar with the basics of Excel and to gain knowledge on how to handle real-world data analysis problems. I have worked with a small dataset and had used Excel (Pivot Table) to solve different tasks that are commonly encountered in data analytics.<br><br>


## Dataset
The data for this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset:
 - **Dataset Link**: [Adidas Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heemalichaudhari/adidas-sales-dataset)<br><br>


## Dataset Columns
Dataset contains total 7 columns namely :

- **Date** - Date of the sales transaction
- **Region** - Geographical region of sales
- **Delivery Person** - Name of the delivery person handling the order
- **Customer ID** - Unique identifier for each customer
- **Food Item** - Name of the food product sold
- **Cost Price** - Purchase cost of the item
- **Selling Price** - Price at which the item was sold
<br><br>

## Business Problems

The company wants to enhance its sales performance and operational efficiency by addressing key challenges, including:

- Identifying which regions generate the highest and lowest sales and optimizing marketing and distribution strategies accordingly.
- Understanding the top customers' impact on revenue to create targeted retention and engagement strategies.
- Evaluating delivery personnel sales performance to improve efficiency and reward high performers.
- Analyzing monthly sales trends to identify peak and low-performing periods for better inventory and marketing decisions.<br><br>

## Dashboard Features 

- **Sales by Region** -  Breakdown of sales performance by different regions.
- **Best Customers** - Top 10 customers.
- **Monthly Sales Trends** - Visualization of sales over time.
- **Delivery Performance** - Analysis of delivery performance by delivery partners.<br><br>


## Tools Used  

- **Microsoft Excel** - Data visualization & dashboard creation<br><br>


## How To Use  

- Download the Excel file from this repository.
- Open it in Microsoft Excel.
- Navigate through different sheets to explore raw data, pivot tables, and charts.
- Use the dashboard to filter insights dynamically.<br><br>


## Dashboard Previews

## Findings

- The North West region has the highest sales (~49,723), while the South East has the lowest (~39,059). The company should focus on improving sales in underperforming regions through targeted marketing and promotions.
- Certain customers (e.g., C11 and C2) contribute significantly to revenue. A loyalty program or personalized offers could be implemented to retain these high-value customers.
- Sales contributions vary among delivery personnel, with some outperforming others. Identifying best practices from top performers and providing additional training to lower performers can improve overall efficiency.
- There is noticeable fluctuation in monthly sales, with peaks and dips. Seasonal trends should be analyzed further to align marketing and stock availability with high-demand periods.<br><br>

## Conclusion
This project provides an excellent opportunity for me as a beginners to gain Excel knowledge to solve practical data problems. By working through these, I gain hands-on experience with Visulization, graphs, date manipulation, and conditional logic.
